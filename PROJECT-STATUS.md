## 🎯 Current Deployment Status: READY TO DEPLOY! 🚀

## 🚦 Deployment Status: GREEN LIGHT! 

**All systems operational** - Infrastructure is ready for immediate deployment via CI/CD pipeline.

### ✅ Deployment Readiness Checklist 

**GitHub Actions (Recommended)**
- ✅ Repository: https://github.com/Tulasi2710/AKS-Infrastructure-Project.git
- ✅ Secrets configured: AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, TF_STATE_*
- ✅ Workload Identity Federation operational
- ⏳ Production environment (needs manual creation)

**Azure DevOps (Alternative)**
- ✅ Pipeline: Updated with modern Terraform tasks
- ✅ Service connection: Configured for authentication
- ✅ Variable groups: Ready for backend configuration

### 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create Production Environment** in GitHub (Settings → Environments → New environment: `production`)
2. **Trigger Deployment** by pushing to main branch or manual workflow trigger
3. **Monitor Progress** in GitHub Actions tab
4. **Approve Deployment** when prompted in production environment
5. **Verify AKS Cluster** creation in Azure Portal
